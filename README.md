# SpamFilterModel_UsingNaiveBayesClassifier
This Python code builds a spam filter using a Naive Bayes classifier. It processes text data, splits it into training and testing sets, vectorizes the text, trains the model, and evaluates its performance using accuracy and confusion matrix. The script provides a simple yet effective approach to spam detection.
